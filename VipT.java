 *        - The following file defines a specialization of the Ticket class
 *        known as VipT, representing VIP tickets. This class purely exists
 *        to be
 *        a different type of Ticket, but does not have any unique attributes of
 *        its own.  There is a method defined specifically for this class, which
 *        is for processing the purchase of a VIP ticket.

 *        assignment online in any form, or
 *        view/received/modified code written from anyone else. All deliverables
 *        were produced entirely on my own. This
 *        assignment is part of an academic course at The University of Texas at
 *        El Paso and a grade will be assigned for
